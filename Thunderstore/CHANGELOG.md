## 1.0.1
- Small playtesting shows that the default beacon cooldowns are too low, so they have been increased by a bit.
  - Healing + Shocking Beacon Cooldowns: 40s -> 60s
  - Equipment Beacon Cooldown: 60s -> 90s
  - hacking Beacon Cooldown: 180s -> 240s
  - Of course, you can change these in the configs still.

- As of the second DLC's release, the beacons seem to be resetting sooner than they should be.
It should be fixed as of this version.

- Backup mags used to (unintentionally) increase the max number of charges of the right beacon. This has now been fixed this update

## 1.0.0

- Initial release
