# ROR2-Captain-Beacon-Cooldown-and-Tweaks

## Description

A mod for risk of rain 2 that gives cooldowns to captain's beacons,
allowing him to use them more than once on each stage. Has config support.

## Potential Future Plans

This mod may be updated later to give more captain tweaks down the line such as the following:

1. Fix diablo strike to actually do "40,000% damage to all characters" \- Ability Description

  - Currently, the ability does 40,000% damage to targets in the inner half
    radius, and 10,000% outside that half radius (sweetspot falloff), instead of the 40000% to everything it states

2. Allowing usage of captain orbitals in areas where they are usually disabled.
   - Such as the bazaar, or the void fields.
   - A mod already exists that fixes this, so priority isn't that high for this feature

## Bandoliers don't work

Bandoliers do not work with beacons mainly for balance reasons, but also due to the beacons having weird
stopwatch behaviour that I wasn't able to enable/fix.
May be fixed in the future.

## Default Beacon Cooldowns

- Healing Beacon: 60s
- Shocking Beacon: 60s
- Equipment Beacon: 90s
- Hacking Beacon: 240s
